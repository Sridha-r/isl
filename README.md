# isl

source venv/bin/activate(linux/bash)

if you open the terminal on pycharm it usually activates the virtual environment by itself

So the typical workflow is:

Navigate to your project or virtual environment folder.

Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command for your OS/terminal.

Run your Python scripts or commands within the activated environment.

No need to recreate the environment unless you want a fresh setup.
